0005,000012,Metalachi,,,,"Sun, October 10, 2021",Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 7:00 PM,,All Ages," THE STORY OF METALACHI… On a hot summer night in Veracruz Mexico circa 1982,Consuela Espinoza stumbled out of her dilapidatedshanty and into Rock N Roll history. What began as aninnocent night of snorting horse tranquilizers in a hotelroom with seven members of the village jai alai teamwent on to produce the greatest metal band to ever live.Unhampered by a steady regime of tequila and illadvised sumo lessons, nine months later five bastardchildren were born. Unable to care for her hungryoffspring and concerned that motherhood wouldseriously interfere with her Tuesday night Karaokeleague, Consuela hastily packed the babies into thesaddlebags of a burro and sent her children off toAmerica in search of a better life. Against all odds, 14years later, and nearly dead from dehydration, the burroknelt down to drink from the stagnant waters of the RioGrande just outside of Juarez Mexico –mere yards fromthe U.S. border. With one fleeting burst of energy thebrothers Espinoza cinco climbed from their leatherrestraints and scampered the vast reaches of the river,collapsing onto the sweet amber hue of American soil. Asif by destiny, lodged in the sand beneath their tannedfaces was a record sleeve upon which were the words“PARANOID” and “BLACK SABBATH”. For many years tofollow, this definitive black metal album served not onlyas a teacher and a mentor..but also as a friend. Fromthese bleak and humble begins grew the seed that wouldeventually be the band we know today. Often referred toas the greatest heavy metal band to ever live..alwaysreferred to as…METALACHI.

0005,000013,King's X,,,Bezel,"Fri, October 29, 2021",Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," 						Few hard rock bands are as widely respected yet criminally overlooked as King's X. The trio (bassist/vocalist Doug Pinnick, guitarist/vocalist Ty Tabor, and drummer/vocalist Jerry Gaskill) seemed destined for the big time with their irresistible blend of melodic Beatlesque harmonies, metallic riffing, and prog rock detours, yet for reasons unknown, never truly broke through to a mainstream audience. Pinnick (b. September 3, 1950) first met Gaskill (b. December 27, 1957) when the duo was touring with the Christian rock outfit Petra, and soon after, met up-and-coming guitarist Tabor (b. September 17, 1961). The trio joined forces in 1980 with the Top 40 cover band the Edge and thoroughly played the Missouri bar scene. By 1983, the band had changed their name to Sneak Preview and was now completely focusing on their original compositions -- resulting in an obscure and very hard to find self-titled debut album released around this time. Sneak Preview was offered a recording contract in 1985 if they relocated to Houston, TX, which they did, but the deal failed to materialize. Undeterred, the trio continued on and perfected their sound and songwriting further, catching a break when ZZ Top video producer Sam Taylor took the group under his wing, helping them secure a recording contract with New York's Megaforce label in 1987, and suggesting that they change their name to King's X (the name of a local outfit that Taylor was an admirer of back in his high school days). In 1988, King's X released their debut album, Out of the Silent Planet. Despite praise amongst critics, the public didn't know exactly what to make of the group's original and multi-genre encompassing style, and the album sank without a trace. But with their sophomore release, 1989's classic Gretchen Goes to Nebraska, a buzz began to develop around the band in the metal community, as members of Anthrax and Living Colour praised King's X in the press, and MTV granted a few airings of their anthemic track ""Over My Head."" The stage was set for the group's big breakthrough, and things appeared to be going according to plan when their third release, Faith Hope Love, surfaced in late 1990. The album just missed the U.S. Top 30 and nearly reached gold certification, due to landing a lengthy spot opening on AC/DC's sold out arena tour in both the states and Europe, while the Beatlesque ""It's Love"" received major airtime on MTV. What should have been an exciting time for the band quickly turned sour, however, as King's X began to experience trouble with manager Taylor. 1992's self-titled release (the group's first to appear on Atlantic Records without the Megaforce imprint) proved not to be as focused as their previous pair of albums, resulting in the album disappearing quickly from sight after release (and their ensuing tour halted), as they ended their relationship with Taylor. But it appeared as though the change had refueled the group's musical desire once again, as evidenced by the Brendan O'Brien-produced, stellar 1994 release, Dogman, which performed respectfully on the charts. This success resulted in the band opening shows for Pearl Jam and a show-stopping performance on the opening night of the mammoth Woodstock '94 festival. Atlantic Records began putting pressure on the trio to deliver a breakthrough hit but when 1996's Ear Candy failed to live up to expectations, King's X left the label (Atlantic would issue one more release from the band a year later, The Best Of, which featured 13 fan favorites, as well as three unreleased compositions and a live track). 1998 saw the group sign to the Metal Blade label, as both Pinnick and Tabor issued their first solo albums (Tabor with Moonflower Lane and Pinnick with Massive Grooves, the latter issued under the alias Poundhound), followed by the group's seventh studio release overall, Tapehead. Now free to issue albums at their own pace, the group issued two more albums only a year apart -- 2000's Please Come Home...Mr. Bulbous and 2001's Manic Moonlight. Pinnick continued his solo career in conjunction to King's X, issuing Poundhound's second release, Pineappleskunk, the same year (as well as forming a side-project with former members of Trouble, dubbed Supershine), while Tabor issued two albums with the prog metal supergroup Platypus -- 1998's When Pus Comes to Shove and 2000's Ice Cycles. Around the same time, King's X received a pleasant accolade from their peers when they were voted as one of the ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" on a VH1 TV special. In 2003, the band released Black Like Sunday, a collection of re-recorded songs from early in their career that had previously only existed as demos or bootlegs. Their first concert album, Live All Over the Place, arrived the following year, followed by their eleventh studio recording, Ogre Tones, in 2005.

0005,000014,Caroline Polachek,,,Sara King,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," Caroline Polachek’s critically acclaimed solo debut has taken the music world by a storm. A lush and dazzling head-trip, Pang has captured the hearts of a fast-growing audience of romantic pop devotees since it’s October 2019 release. Known equally for her exhilarating live vocal performances, Caroline is bringing Pang in it’s full surrealist-goth theatricality to select cities and festivals throughout 2020.   Polachek has already lived an extraordinary life in music. Her previous band, Chairlift, formed in 2006 while Caroline was in art school in New York City, and her idiosyncratic vocal style and synth textures quickly became their sonic trademark, which continued to evolve through their three critically acclaimed albums.   Caroline expanded into production in 2013, landing her first credit writing and producing on Beyonce's Grammy-nominated self-titled album. Restless while making Chairlift's third (and final) record Moth, Caroline quietly fostered two side projects: baroque girl-group Ramona Lisa, and minimal synth project CEP. Moving fluidly through radically different genres, Caroline collaborated with dozens of artists (Blood Orange, SBTRKT, Charli XCX); sometimes writing, sometimes singing, sometimes directing videos, and sometimes all three.   Chairlift disbanded in 2017 and Caroline feverishly began writing for her first solo project under her own name. For the first time, the DNA of these previous projects fused; the playfulness of Chairlift, the psych-classicism of Ramona Lisa, the futuristic glimmerings of CEP, plus a newfound mastery of her voice.   Fast forward two years spent manically between the studio and navigating a series of intense personal crossroads, and Pang is decidedly the most ambitious, hardcore and beautiful record of her career to date. With her signature 'organic autotune' and liquid lyricism center stage, Pang positions her firmly as one of the most singular and captivating singer-songwriters of a generation.

0005,000015,Kash Doll,,,,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages,"  With tens of millions of independent streams, widespread critical acclaim, and her hometown of Detroit cheering her on, Kash Doll asserts herself as hip-hop's next champion. Following a tireless grind, she proves downright inescapable. Now, she chronicles every moment of this rollercoaster ride on her anxiously awaited full-length debut.  Growing up in one of Detroit’s roughest neighborhoods, Kash Doll led a far from semi-charmed upbringing. “Life in Detroit was rocky,” she recalls. “It wasn’t all bad but I knew I was destined to do bigger things and wanted to get out of that environment.” Young Kash lost her father on her first birthday, a date that would prove to be bittersweet in the years to come. Performing since the age of two, she’d jump on her living room couch to cover hits by Anita Baker and Aretha Franklin. She spent much of her childhood exploring her creativity through writing short stories and imaginative poetry as her escape from the world around her. Like her debut mixtape Keisha Vs. Kash Doll would later reflect, the budding artist led a life of duality. “One minute I was walking around in my momma’s heels wearing a tiara and the next I was in my gym shoes running around with the boys,” she says with a laugh. “One side of me has always been cocky; the other side is incredibly humble.” The eldest of six children, Kash worked multiple jobs to help support her family and help her mom raise her other siblings. “I worked at Little Caesars, Ethan Allen, a temp agency, babysitting…anywhere there was money, I was there,” she explains. As a creative youth, she was often misunderstood and picked on by her peers in school for being different. Kash was determined to still express herself through her art by kicking freestyles on the walk to school and writing rhymes in her spare time. It would take some years before she’d even begin recording.  In 2014, Kash dropped her critically acclaimed debut mixtape Keisha Vs. Kash Doll. It was the project that arguably proved she was geared for greatness and gave people a glimpse into her life. Like the greats, Biggie, Eminem and Jay-Z who all made less than favorable choices in the streets in order to make a living, Kash had to fight from nothing and do what was necessary to survive. Kash used the money she earned from dancing to invest in a beauty bar business and studio time, which resulted in getting signed to her first deal. Though the excitement of signing would quickly wear off as she spent the next few years in a proverbial prison, locked in an inescapable recording contract.  “My grind from then until now? That was all on social media platforms,” she explains. “I couldn’t release music. If I put it on YouTube, the label would take it down. Soundcloud, they would take it down. All I had was social media. For a time, I was booking shows all over the country by myself but I was restricted from doing anything else to promote my music or get the same exposure as other artists who could stream, sell and release their music on the radio.” However, Kash kept the momentum going via social media. In May 2016, she dropped Trapped In The Dollhouse with full transparency that she was quite literally trapped in her agreement. The world began to take notice of her hustle. “Things were happening for me because of my amazing fans, aka Kash Bratz, and I just knew it was God telling me not to give up,” Kash says.  Kash’s fans and many of her industry peers began to take notice of her lyricism and drive. Industry leaders began recognize her unique ability to rap about her experiences in the streets without glorifying them, which drew comparisons to male and female hip-hop legends like Eminem, Jay-Z and MC Lyte. By 2016, Kash was starting to show her uniqueness in era dominated by manufactured musicians. Top recording artists began to reach out to her because they connected with her story, her hustle, her rhymes and her rawness. She drew the attention of Rick Ross who gave her a free verse. She earned Drake’s respect and the Toronto rapper invited her to open during the Detroit stop of his Summer Sixteen Tour that August. “I love Drake,” she says. “I can never repay him for that. While I was locked in a contract, not able to release music, the crowd knew every word to my songs. That was one of the highest grossing tours, and I was a part of it.” Then everything began to change. Kash continued the fight to leave her contract. On her birthday (March 14, 2017), she released “For Everybody,” a track that went viral overnight, however, her previous label took it down after over a million streams. They did the same with the Belly-inspired video, but word was already out that Kash Doll was the next to blow up. The goal was to make enough money to keep her legal team fighting. “I did over 70 shows in nine months with no music streaming,” she recalls. Artists continued to reach out to her knowing that she couldn’t release her own music but had so much talent to share. Big Sean added her to the massive “So Good” with Metro Boomin, Remy Ma brought her out on stage at Hot 97’s Summer Jam, Kash was awarded the BMI Social Star Award, and killed her verse in the BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher. By the end of 2017, Kash Doll was finally released from her restrictive contract. “Kash had finally arrived,” she declared. “Now that I’m removed from it, it’s amazing to see how much I really did while being stuck in that contract."" In February 2018, Kash won the Issa Wave Award at the BET Social Awards (along with her first televised performance) and the following month she dropped Brat Mail, also on her birthday. “It was just a collection of songs recorded during my struggle,” she says, “but I had to keep the Kash Bratz fed because they’ve been so good to me.” By the summer, she released The Vault, setting the stage for what’s to come, armed with the street singles “Here I Go” and “Let’s Get This Money.” The mixtape shot straight to Number One on mixtape sites, an indicator of the movement Kash Doll built. Under the direction of new management, her team struck a deal with Republic Records. Most recently, Kash was invited to join DJ Khaled’s set as part of the epic Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s OTRII Tour during the San Diego and Santa Clara stops. For any new artist to have this type of opportunity would have been amazing in and of itself, but Kash was lucky enough to perform back to back in two cities. And kicked off 2019 by joining Meek Mill on the Motivation Tour. After years of building her name and making moves when others would have found it impossible, Kash Doll, who was nominated for a 2019 BET Award for Best Female Hip Hop Artist, is ready for the next phase of her career, and with it comes a new identity. Keisha is the straight-forward tomboy and Kash Doll is the ladylike glamazon. But then there is KD, laid back and unbothered, now that success has finally been achieved.  “This whole album is that vibe,” she expresses of her KD-persona. “I draw from my experiences in the streets, but I’m also about being fly. I talk about becoming a boss despite the crazy real life situations that I’ve been through because I know that there’s other women out there going through the same struggles. I want to touch on a bit of everything. For me, it’s all about embracing every aspect so my fans can finally hear my whole story. If you’ve haven’t heard of me yet, you’ll play this album and know me,” she explains. “And my day one fans will see and hear the growth and my consistency since I’ve been grinding towards this debut album for years.” The album will feature her already released tracks “Kitten” feat. Lil Wayne and her new summer-ready single “Ready Set” feat. Big Sean. In addition to the music, Kash has her hands in several businesses through Kash Doll Enterprises, as well as charities like her initiative B.A.D. (Black American Doll) Girls, which donates dresses and styles young women in the Detroit area during prom season, and helps sponsor community events. She was given the Spirit of Detroit Award in recognition for her continued work to give back to her city. It’s a testament to the fact that Kash Doll has endured multiple hurdles to reach this moment. Kash promises to deliver with her new project and, no matter what, will never stop working. The “grind mode” has definitely paid off and it’s now Kash Doll’s time to assert her title  ",,Performance,Trees Dallas,Night Club,2709 Elm Street,",","Dallas,",TX,75226,https://i.axs.com/2020/01/uploadedimage_5e1cbb5b6cdc5.jpg,,https://www.axs.com/events/389496/kash-doll-tickets?skin=treesdallas,https://www.treesdallas.com/events/detail/389496

0005,000018,Yonder Mountain String Band,,,,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,," For nearly 18 years, Yonder Mountain String Band has redefined bluegrass music, expanding the traditional acoustic genre beyond its previously established boundaries by steadily pushing the envelope into the realms of rock n’ roll and improvisation. YMSB has always played music of their own design, in the process attracting a devout coterie of fans that often resembles a tight knit family on an epic musical journey as Yonder traverses the country with an ever-rigorous tour schedule. Yonder is a quintessential ensemble honing its craft night after night on the road, and the fans are there to experience it in real time. The result is music that doesn’t stand still, it’s always progressing and breaking unprecedented ground. With their latest album, Black Sheep (scheduled for national release on their own Frog Pad Records at Telluride Bluegrass Festival on June 16, 2015), Yonder Mountain String Band — Adam Aijala (guitar, vocals), Dave Johnston (banjo, vocals), Ben Kaufmann (bass, vocals), Allie Kral (violin, vocals), and Jacob Jolliff (mandolin, vocals) — begins a new era. The first YMSB release produced by the band itself, Black Sheep is, by any measure, a triumph, perhaps the most mesmeric of their career. The result, says Kaufmann, is that, “This record sounds more like Yonder than any record we’ve ever done. I’m hoping that when people are finished listening to it, they’ll just hit play and listen to it again.” Black Sheep marks the first time in Yonder’s history that they’re actually utilizing, throughout an entire record, the conventional five-piece instrumental arsenal of bluegrass introduced in the 1940s: guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle and bass. With the exception of the album’s sole cover tune, “Ever Fallen In Love,” originally by the late ’70s British punk-rock band the Buzzcocks, each of the album’s new tracks were written by the YMSB members during the past couple of years. Three of the new songs — “Annalee,” “Landfall” and the title track — have already been road-tested on tour; others will be added to the band’s live repertoire following the album’s release. The majority of Black Sheep was recorded at Coupe Studios in Boulder, Colorado, with Adam handling much of the engineering at his home studio and while on the road; the first time a band member has taken on that task. Even on first listen, it becomes instantaneously apparent that Black Sheep is the work of a new Yonder Mountain String Band, one with a strong commitment to re-exhibiting itself and broadening its parameters following the departure of a founding member. While it’s immediately recognizable as YMSB music, there’s undeniably a raw aesthetic to the studio tracks — a sense of daring is embedded in both the instrumental interaction between these five singular players and in the lyrical content of each song. Yonder has its roots in the year 1998, when the original quartet came together in Colorado. Through steadfast gigging in all manner of venues from small clubs to massive outdoor festivals, Yonder Mountain String Band quickly built a robust fanbase while continually experimenting to define its sound. Some of the most fervent audiences were at jam band shows and festivals, where fans took readily to YMSB’s potent mix of the traditional bluegrass of Bill Monroe, the Stanley Brothers and Doc Watson and the improvisational sensibilities of the Grateful Dead and Phish. Also deeply ingrained in the band, albeit more subtly, was a fierce love for punk, which provided the members with seminal influences while they were growing up. “We didn’t even hear bluegrass until our 20s,” says Aijala. “Falling in love with the sound of bluegrass instruments, while also having all of these outside influences that had nothing to do with bluegrass — well, what comes out isn’t what we envisioned.” With the band’s 17th anniversary coming this summer, and an extensive tour schedule running throughout the year, a revitalized Yonder Mountain takes delight in the fact that they are still reaching new fans while simultaneously retaining the characteristics that brought their greater community together in the first place. The loss of one member and the subsequent invitation for some of today’s top pickers to help shape their evolving sound brings intriguing opportunities to the table; ones that set YMSB on its new path. Black Sheep is a bold statement, meant to passionately get fans up on their feet and ecstatically dancing, but it’s also about embracing the moment. Essential changes are a healthy step in keeping the music alive and well. “We’ve been growing over the years and I feel like we really don’t have any limitations,” says Aijala. “It doesn’t feel like work when you get to hang out with people that you care about and play music.” Adds Kaufmann, “It’s not just bluegrass — it’s progressive. Everything Yonder has ever tried to do, we’re doing in this record.  ",,Performance,Trees Dallas,Night Club,2709 Elm Street,",","Dallas,",TX,75226,https://i.axs.com/2015/02/yonder-mountain-string-band_02-20-15_19_54e78f3969b60.jpg,,https://www.axs.com/events/390265/yonder-mountain-string-band-tickets?skin=treesdallas,https://www.treesdallas.com/events/detail/390265
0005,000019,Dayglow,,,,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," On his full-length debut Fuzzybrain, Austin-based artist Dayglow reveals his rare gift for illuminating emotional pain in a way that not only resonates, but ultimately makes that pain feel lighter. With its bright textures and effervescent melodies, glistening guitar tones and radiant vocals, the album instantly invites a dreamy euphoria, even as it gets incredibly candid about isolation and anxiety and loss. “For as long as I’ve made music, it’s been my goal to use it to help people feel better, and hopefully treat each other better,” says the singer/songwriter otherwise known as Sloan Struble. “I believe that all art can do something good for the world, as long as artists can recognize its potential and embrace that responsibility.” Gracefully threaded throughout the album, the optimism of Fuzzybrain is both hard-won and palpably sincere. Originally from Aledo, Texas—a Fort Worth suburb he refers to as a “small, football-crazed town”—Struble felt irrevocably out of place for most of his adolescence, eventually turning to music as a purposeful escape from his surroundings. “I didn’t really feel connected to what everyone else in my school was into, so making music became an obsession for me, and sort of like therapy in a way,” says Struble, now 20-years-old. “I’d just dream about it all day in class, and then come home and work on songs instead of doing homework. After a while I realized I’d made an album.” True to the intensely personal nature of Fuzzybrain, Struble kept the project entirely to himself all throughout its creation. “Usually artists will have demos they’ll bounce off other people to get some feedback, but nobody except for my parents down the hall really heard much of the album until I put it out,” he says. Soon after self-releasing Fuzzybrain in fall 2018, Struble began earning widespread attention for the album, drawing an online following struck by the pure positivity of Dayglow’s output. “People have been really kind about getting in touch with me and telling me that the album makes them happy, or that it’s helped them through a rough time,” he says. “That was my greatest goal for it, so it’s amazing to hear that people feel that way.” Working completely on his own with a miniscule collection of gear—his guitar, computer, some secondhand keyboards snagged at Goodwill—Struble created Fuzzybrain by transforming his private outpouring into a batch of songs often grandiose in scale. On the title track, for instance, he lets off a barrage of lyrics likely to strike a chord with the hyper-introspective (“Scattered mind, I call it a friend/I wish I thought a bit less and spoke up instead”), simultaneously sweetening the mood with swooning melodies and luminous synth. One of Fuzzybrain’s most melancholy moments, “Dear Friend,” offers up a tender serenade to an old pen pal, its sensitivity both heartcrushing and beautifully refreshing (“I know the world is changing quickly/And I couldn’t tell you why/It’s beyond my understanding/But I’d love it if we tried”). And on “Hot Rod,” Dayglow delights in a bit of good-natured insolence, spiking the track with a tempestuous guitar solo and breezily delivered lyrical digs (e.g., “I’m sorry for not wanting to be your décor”). Though Struble describes Fuzzybrain as “DIY to the fullest extent,” the album unfolds with an immaculately constructed sound design that owes much to his uncompromising work ethic—an element illustrated in the making of a disarmingly wistful track titled “Can I Call You Tonight?” “I had the instrumental for that song fully produced for months before I had a purpose to put to it, lyrically,” he says. “I kept coming back to it every day, and then one day I got off the phone with a friend and the power was out in my house, so I just started writing down little phrases from our call and turned that into the lyrics.” In finishing up “Can I Call You Tonight?”, Struble cycled through nearly 30 separate final mixes before settling on the version that best captured the track’s tone. “I kept running back and forth from my room to my car, just listening to the mix over and over and making sure it sounded the way it needed to,” he recalls. Dayglow is now gearing up for a more fully realized version of Fuzzybrain to be released, featuring two new tracks: “Nicknames” (a bold and bouncy number he perceives as a counterpart to “Hot Rod”) and “Listerine” (an undeniably potent track fueled by Struble’s confident vocal flow and flashes of jagged guitar work). “Both those songs were written around the same time as the rest of the album and very much exist in the Fuzzybrain universe,” he says. “Each is deeply intertwined into the conceptual universe and purpose of Fuzzybrain, and it just wouldn’t feel right releasing them in a separate body of work.” As his audience widens to include fans around the world, Dayglow pushes forward with a mission of making music that strengthens hope, promotes peace, and—in an especially important turn for Struble—fosters a powerful sense of community. “When people come to the shows, I obviously want them to have fun and feel good—but more than that, I want them to make friends,” he says. “The impact of a show only lasts so long, but if you end up making a friend there, that impact can last quite a long time. I’d really love for people to share this whole experience in a way that goes beyond just the music.”  ",,Performance,Trees Dallas,Night Club,2709 Elm Street,",","Dallas,",TX,75226,https://i.axs.com/2020/01/uploadedimage_5e1d442a1e25b.jpg,,https://www.axs.com/events/390406/dayglow-tickets?skin=treesdallas,https://www.treesdallas.com/events/detail/390406
0005,000020,Between the Buried and Me,,,,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," What if dreams could be broadcast for the purpose of entertainment? Could you consume theinnermost thoughts of another person on screen? If you could, what does that say about anattention-starved audience? More importantly, what would become of the dreamer?Between The Buried and Me pose those questions and more on their two-part eighth full-length and introductory offering for Sumerian Records, Automata. The North Carolinaquintet—Tommy Giles Rogers, Jr. [lead vocals, keyboards], Paul Waggoner [lead and rhythmguitar, backing and lead vocals], Dustie Waring [rhythm and lead guitar], Blake Richardson[drums], and Dan Briggs [bass, keyboards]—explore these themes by personally smashingboundaries once again. Automata marks the band’s first proper double LP-spanning concept. Itsees them venture into new territory with visual accompaniment for the entire body of work.Moreover, they continue to expand their ever-evolving style, upholding a tradition ofprogression in the process. “We never want to repeat ourselves,” affirms Paul. “We’re always trying to do somethingdifferent, and this album fell right into that sort of pattern. We push ourselves into new places,while retaining our basic sound. Musically, we go somewhere that’s fun and challenging. Wenever know how it’s going to turn out. These are uncharted waters for us. We’ve never takenon a visual capacity of this magnitude. We’ve never written an entire piece and presented it inseparate parts like this.” Tommy agrees, “This many years into our career, we want to continue doing things differently.”This approach cemented the group as progressive music’s most unpredictable outlier since itsformation in 2000. Among many milestones, they released 2007’s watershed Colors followed byThe Parallax: Hypersleep Dialogues EP in 2011 and The Parallax II: Future Sequence a year later.2015 saw Coma Ecliptic elevate them to new heights yet again. Not only did it bow at #12 onthe Billboard Top 200 (a career high for the band), but it also garnered widespread acclaim fromNoisey, Revolver, Alternative Press, and The Guardian who welcomed the album with a rareperfect score. In between, they launched countless sold out headline tours and support runswith the likes of Mastodon. Now, they break more ground with Automata. “Lyrically, I wanted to write something that I treated as a puzzle until it comes together at theend,” continues Tommy. “For as deep and dark as it is, there’s a positive outcome, which we’venever had. The story follow a protagonist whose dreams are used as entertainmentbroadcasted by a company called Voice of Trespass. Most of the record takes place within thatdream. The character thinks it’s all real.” “Even though it takes place in the future, there are a lot of parallels to modern society,” addsPaul. “Oftentimes, we turn athletes, movie stars, and musicians into commodities. We forgetthat they’re real people with problems and issues. They’re society’s escape from reality as weuse them for entertainment. Hence, society plays a role in their downfall, be it drug dependence, isolation, or even suicide. Society perpetuates mental illness with those expectations.” Automata – Part I unveils the first six songs comprising the entire body of work. Stretching nearseven minutes, “Condemned to the Gallows” kicks off this journey. Acoustic guitar builds in epicfashion before sweeping distortion takes hold followed by unpredictable rhythms and a seismicvocal performance which, as Tommy puts it, “sets up the whole story.”Elsewhere, the trudging eight-minute guitar symphony of “Yellow Eyes” spirals into the melodicbliss of “Millions.” “There are a lot of moments where we totally venture away from the traditional formula ofwhat a progressive metal band can do,” states Dan. “There are all these little moments wherewe’ve done something we never did before. ‘Millions’ is the perfect example. It’s four-minutesof straight melody—another first.” With Automata Part I, Part II, and the myriad of visuals on the horizon, Between The BuriedAnd Me realize their potential to its fullest—and go one step further.“All of our music should build up to the newest record,” Tommy leaves off. “That’s whathappens with Automata. You can take little snippets from our past throughout this album. Itsounds like Between The Buried And Me, but it’s still new. We hope to keep the music industryon its toes. This is part of doing that.” ",,Performance,Trees Dallas,Night Club,2709 Elm Street,",","Dallas,",TX,75226,https://i.axs.com/2020/01/uploadedimage_5e1d01fe66c96.jpg,,https://www.axs.com/events/390444/between-the-buried-and-me-tickets?skin=treesdallas,https://www.treesdallas.com/events/detail/390444

0005,000023,Inner Wave,,,Divino Niño,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," With the mind of an electronic producer, the body of a lo-fi psychedelic band, and the spirit of Latin inspired hip-hop rhythms, INNER WAVE creates a genre-bending brand of ethereal synth-wave that takes the listener on a journey that can get as centered or as cosmic as you see fit. This Los Angeles five-piece has been playing music together since they were 13 years old and their musical cohesion shines through. Hailing from the South-LA neighborhood of Inglewood, (an area known more for it's hip-hop roots than indie cred), Inner Wave has carved a unique sound that branches off into lo-fi psychedelia, while still paying tribute to their home in the Southland. After breakout record, Sun Transmission, the band has made a name for themselves in the local Los Angeles scene, embarking on a west coast tour with indie rockers, Hot Flash Heat Wave and just wrapped up a US tour withbedroom pop band, Triathlon- selling out multiple venues including the legendary Roxy on sunset strip in Los Angeles. August 25, 2017, INNER WAVE was proud to release their full-length record, Underwater Pipe Dreams. With a lush, eclectic sound the album takes a wide range of inspirations from Tame Impala to Lil Ugly Mane. Songwriter, Pablo Sotelo, even sites sci-fi films like Blade Runner, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange as thematic influences. Recorded at the band's home studio dubbed, ""The Swamp,"" Underwater Pipe Dreams is an album that comes three years in the making  It's a musical voyage suitable for a dance party or a beach hangout, a late night drive, or a far out dream sequence. In addition to releasing the record, last year INNER WAVE played Tropicalia Festival in Long Beach, CA and a mini-festival at The Observatory Santa Ana that included acts Tyler the Creator, BROCKHAMPTON, & Clairo.

0005,000025,Gondwana,,,E.N Young,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," For over thirty years, the Chilean band Gondwana has been touring, performing, and recording uninterrupted. Emerging from the underground music scene during the brutal dictatorship of Agusto Pinochet, Gondwana brings forth a fresh blend of Latin and Jamaican rhythms among other influences such as Rock n’ Roll and soul. With pulsating energy and a smooth, original sound, eight polished musicians are the soul of Chile's number one reggae band.  Through songs dealing with various themes such as romantic love, general love, universal unity, social consciousness, uprising, and spiritual praise, Gondwana reveals both positive and realists messages that serve as an uplifting force for fans of all musical genres. Spirit-moving falsetto notes, bubbling bass, hard drums, guitar solos and arrangements, and horns are the primary ingredients found in the highly acclaimed band’s music. Without a doubt, Gondwana is one of the most prestigious, solid reggae bands to emerge from South America. With constant movement across the world and a myriad of vibrant live performances, Gondwana continues to deliver an acclaimed repertoire of hits and new material. The band is internationally recognized as one of Chile’s most successful musical acts – not just in reggae but across all genres. Already superstars in their native Chile and throughout South America, Gondwana has been gaining very enthusiastic fans throughout the world, as evident by their extensive social media following and a sizeable number of international concerts per year. From its humble beginnings in La Pincoya, a notorious northern Santiago slum, to a leading position in Chilean pop music, Gondwana has remained true to their original posture, standing tall and strong in a peace-loving position of musical and lyrical creation.  Formed in 1987 by founder, writer, composer, producer, and bassist I-Locks Labbe, Gondwana has been awarded several multi-platinum albums throughout its 30+ year career. Additionally, they’ve performed numerous times in what are known to be some of the most important festivals throughout the continent. Recently, Gondwana has performed at various renowned festivals such as ""Reggae on the River Fest,” ""Rock Al Parque"" Colombia, “Jamming Fest” Colombia ""Vive Latino"" Mexico, ""Pepsi Music Fest"" Argentina, ""Cosquin Rock"" Argentina, ""Quito Fest"" Ecuador, twice at the prestigious ""Vina del Mar Festival"" in Chile, “Ruido Fest” in Chicago, “Lollapalooza” in Chile, and they were the first Latin band to perform at “Cali Roots” in California in 2016. Gondwana has also embarked on numerous worldwide tours such as a 2016 North American Tour that included 53 shows, thus, making it the longest consecutive tour by a Latin reggae band in North America. Some of the cities included Mexico City, Tijuana, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Vancouver, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Denver, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, Miami, Orlando, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington D.C., New York City, Boston, Montreal, Cleveland, Chicago, and Nashville. The band has also performed in Spain, Sweden, Finland, Germany, and France. Since 2010, the band has averaged over 70 concerts per year and has toured the United States and Canada every year since 2011 and occasionally between 1998 and 2009). A surprising aspect of Gondwana is their notable digital and social media activity as demonstrated by their ever-growing YouTube fan base that’s currently includes over 130 million views with an average of 30,000 monthly visitors accessing the band's official website www.gondwana.cl, and over 1 million followers on Facebook, over 1.2 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and 150,000 followers on Instagram. Furthermore, many of their songs have surpassed the 20 million mark on Spotify, including “Setimiento Original,” “Antonia,” and Verde, Amarillo, y Rojo.” This can only be attributed to a strong bond and romance between the band and its fans. The fact that the band maintains such a fan base demonstrates what a massive impact the band has had around the world, especially considering that the band has lacked the support from prominent producers or the support of any one of the major record labels during recent years. Their most recent album was released in early 2017, titled Carpe Diem, with notable features such as Bob Marley’s son, Ky-Mani Marley, Los Autenticos Decadentes, and Matthew Jacquette from Miami. The album was released in May of 2017 under the prestigious Argentina label, PopArt. Their previous album, released in 2015, was titled “Reggae n’ Roll,” a name that provides a tribute to one of Gondwana’s greatest genre influence: Rock n’ Roll. It is worth noting that the most influential band for Gondwana was The Police, a classic rock band. In fact, its founder and chief songwriter, bassist I-Locks Labbe began his music career after witnessing The Police perform at the Viña del Mar music festival in 1982; the inspirations provided by The Police’s concert led to Labbe forming what would become Gondwana in 1987 and eventually performing at the same festival 10 years later. GONDWANA is officially comprised of the following members:I-Locks Labbe on bass (30 years with the band), Keno “Fingaman” Valenzuela on keyboards (27 years with the band), and Jorge “Gato” Ramos on saxophone (25 years with the band). Current permanent guest musicians include singer and songwriter Maximiliano “Maxi” Vargas who is currently enjoying his second stint with the band after performing with the band for 5 years in the past. Other musicians include Nelson “Pez” Lopez on guitar (25 years with the band), “Pancho” Contreras on trumpet (15 years with the band), Francisco “Panty Tone” Martinez on guitar and backup vocals (5 years with the band), and Claudio Loyola on drums (1 year with the band but had previously performed and recorded with the band for 6 years in the past).

0005,000030,Zepparella,,,Desolation Angels,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," How to honor the legacy of a band deemed sacred? To tread on holy ground is perilous, and must be done with the intent and spirit of a disciple—Pay attention to the intricacies of the magic, explore the far ends of the innovation, strive for ever-growing ability, and let the purity of the love for the music drive it all. Drummer Clementine is the founding member of ZEPPARELLA. From the beginning of her musical career, her goal has been to be onstage every night. The pursuit of that goal has led Clementine to constantly tour the US and Europe in projects as diverse as Bottom, AC/DShe, The House Of More, The Solid, Francis Bakin, and Stars Turn Me On. She tackles the best rock drumming ever written with her own emotionally powerful style, bringing the Motown influence of the Bonham groove to the forefront. The profound musical connection established with Gretchen Menn (guitar), Angeline Saris (bass), and Noelle Doughty (vocals) creates the bond required to do this great music justice. It was under the tutelage of classical guitarist Phillip DeFremery, a student of Andrés Segovia, that guitarist Gretchen Menn began her path on the instrument. Playing with tireless passion and constantly seeking out new challenges, her projects are often unconventional, genre-bending expressions combining elements of classical, rock, progressive, jazz, and metal. On influences, Gretchen has never tired of her initial inspirations—Eric Johnson, Steve Morse, Frank Zappa, and Jeff Beck. But she has loved Jimmy Page’s guitar playing longer than she has played the guitar. It was through the music of Led Zeppelin that she found a gateway into music that resonated deeply with her, creating a love for guitar-oriented music, and, ultimately, the guitar. Bassist Angeline Saris has musical passions that span jazz to speed metal, R&B to rock, Cuban to hip-hop, and flamenco to rockabilly. Angeline has done it all - and does it extremely well. It is this versatility, her rock-solid time, tastefully crafted bass lines, and unequivocal skills that give her the ability to bring cohesion to the eclectic Zeppelin catalog. Angeline credits John Paul Jones as a main influence, so it is no surprise that she shines as she interprets his thunder. Finally, singer Noelle Doughty has found her way back to where she started, with a passion for Led Zeppelin’s music that was developed from as far back as she can remember, as the little sister in the room with the rocking older brothers. The kid who knew every word to every song has worked in classic rock cover bands, jazz bands, funk bands, and yet never lost her true love for Zeppelin. After moving to the West Coast from New York State, her fortuitous meeting with Gretchen Menn backstage at a Robert Plant concert brought the final puzzle piece to the Zepparella family. Noelle’s clear and powerful style and deep understanding of the emotional content of these great songs make the picture complete. Now more than ever, Zepparella explores their own improvised magic within the framework of Zeppelin’s mighty songs!

Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages,"  With humble beginnings in Baltimore and then solidifying their lineup in Raleigh, North Carolina, the genre-blending quintet called alesana has come a long way in order to bring you their musical vision and incendiary live performance. Exploring the heights of love and the lows of heartbreak and bitterness that often follow, alesana's music strikes a universal chord with audiences around the world. Fans embrace the emotional sincerity and undeniable intensity of the music while reveling in the reckless abandon with which alesana performs.   Formed in October 2004 by guitarist/vocalist Shawn Milke, guitarist Patrick Thompson, vocalist Dennis Lee, and bassist Steven Tomany, alesana quickly became a staple of the burgeoning Raleigh post-hardcore scene. Metal and hardcore fans were drawn to alesana's gut-wrenching vocals, solid riffs, blasting double bass and intelligent breakdowns.  Progressive fans were drawn to their cascading song structures and deft control of dynamics, and emo/pop punk fans were drawn to their catchy hooks and heartfelt lyrics.  In May 2005, alesana began working on their debut EP.  The disc ""Try This With Your Eyes Closed"" was released in mid-June 2005 to an ever-expanding fan base eager to take alesana home with them.   With their additions of Adam Ferguson on third guitar/third vocal,and Jeremy Bryan on drums, alesana is ready to hit the road for their first US tour this summer. Word-of-mouth, internet promotion and online sales have given fans around the world access to alesana, landing the EP in Europe, Australia, Central America and across the nation. Since the release, alesana has been hard at work playing shows across the region (including the Cornerstone Festival and an episode of the MTV series ""My Super-Sweet Sixteen"").

He grew up listening to Too Short, Geto Boys, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Terence Trent D'Arby and Sade. Never having a father figure to look up to, he learned about the game, the streets, and the ladies from his record collection. Now Hollywood is his home, where he found and started his 3 man group ""Dyslexic Speedreaders"" (which also includes Mickey Avalon and Andre Legacy). Dirt Nasty produced their cult hit ""My Dick"" as well as tracks for Living Legends, Mickey Avalon and Andre Legacy (just to name a few). Yup...he's a producer too. Dirt Nasty recently released his self titled, debut album on the label he co-owns, Shoot To Kill Music.

0005,000033,10 Years,,,Islander To Whom it May,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," Sometimes when band members reunite, it's as if no time has passed and nothing has changed. That couldn't be further from the truth for 10 Years. And, that's a good thing. When guitarist/drummer Brian Vodinh and guitarist Matt Wantland returned to the Knoxville, Tennessee alt-metal/post-grunge band for their eighth album and Mascot Records debut, (how to live) AS GHOSTS, they burst through their comfort zones to create something new. Something better. Something career-defining.                ""It's funny, I named our last record, [2015's] From Birth to Burial, because I thought it was our final record because it just didn't feel like 10 Years without Brian and Matt. But having them back is really a reunion of the core writing team and this new record actually feels like a real rebirth for the band,"" says singer Jesse Hasek.               While Vodinh handled drums and guitar on the new album, he's switching to just guitar for the live shows, moving Chad Huff from guitar to bass, while Kyle Mayer stays on drums. ""We're bringing it back the way they should be,"" says Vodinh, who left the band due to family commitments in 2013. ""It feels great to be back with these guys and we're in such a better place musically and creatively than ever before.""               That better place stems, in part, from a more collaborative writing process. ""It used to be that just Jesse and I would write the full song, and the other guys would add a little spice to it. This time, we're starting the writing process as a full band. Sometimes it starts with a riff. Sometimes it starts with a vocal. Our formula is no formula, and it kind of works. And, we work together in a more constructive and healthier environment now,"" explains Vodinh.               The sixth collaborator was Grammy award-winning producer Nick Raskulinecz (Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters, Deftones). ""Nick made us step outside our comfort zone,"" explains Hasek. ""It made for a different sounding record. The one thing we never wanted to do is recreate the same thing over and over. We have always been musicians that love to explore and venture into new horizons.""               It wasn't easy, the band admits. ""Nick threw us curve-balls and challenged us to re-write stuff and do things we normally wouldn't have done. He helped us cut away the fat and really get to the meat and potatoes of each song. He pushed us and was challenging at times, but it helped us grow.""               The result is 10 Years' most dynamic and multi-dimensional record to date. Raskulinecz encouraged the band to strip away some of the vocal production they've grown accustomed to in order to reveal a more intimate side of Hasek. ""Historically, we like to orchestrate a lot of vocal parts. We'll have harmonies and layers. This time around, Nick had us strip a lot of that away. There are a lot of moments where the only vocal is just Jesse, and not this big freaking epic thing. It makes Jesse more human. And I think the more human Jesse comes across, the more relatable his lyrics are,"" says Vodinh.               Raskulinecz also helped Hasek be more straightforward in his lyrics and message. ""In the past, I've written a lot of songs that were pretty ambiguous. But on this record, I'm more comfortable being direct and talking about things that are important to me. I'm older and find myself reflecting on the world more especially after having traveled the world and talk to people and really see what's going on,"" says Hasek.               The title track, (how to live) AS GHOSTS, is one such song. ""After traveling the world and seeing all the political, social, and religious turmoil, it had me thinking about how many people are judging and preparing for death, but are actually missing life. And, instead of using spirituality for good, a lot of people use it to point fingers and judge. Instead of worrying where we end up in the end, we need to focus on the now and the humanity.""               ""Burnout"" is another observation on mankind. ""It's about a person that's right there in the limelight, has every opportunity to see the greatest things in life that are right in front of them, but they are too inside themselves to see it,"" says Hasek.               ""Blood Red Sky"" was originally from a solo EP Vodinh had recorded. ""The song grabbed my ear the first time I heard it because it had such a different vibe,"" says Hasek, ""but I had a different vocal idea for it so we changed it up. It's about the struggle of maintaining everyday life and how fast your existence just flashes before your eyes. But, it also says that we are surviving and will make it through — that we will always fight through.""               On the first single, ""Novacaine,"" Hasek looks inward. ""Six albums and a hundred songs in, I wondered if I've already written my best stuff,"" he admits. ""But at some point, you start to get real adult problems. Life has such a numbing to it. You see people go from such optimism in their 20s to having life just beat them down later. I think we all kind of get desensitized and numb to life on some level. That's what this song is about.""                10 Years has come a long way since their inception in 1999. The band landed a deal with Universal/Republic Records on the strength of their two independent releases, 2001's Into the Half Moon and 2004's Killing All That Holds You. Their major label debut, 2005's The Autumn Effect, debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Album chart thanks to their breakthrough hit, ""Wasteland,"" which topped Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart, and ""Through the Iris,"" which hit No. 20 on Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.             The band followed that success with 2008's Division, featuring co-production work from Rick Parashar (Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam). The album peaked at No. 12 on The Billboard 200 and spawned the hit ""Beautiful,"" which reached No. 6 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. The momentum continued with 2010's Feeding the Wolves, which was produced by Howard Benson (My Chemical Romance, 3 Doors Down) and bowed at No. 17 on The Billboard 200, while the single, ""Shoot It Out,"" peaked at No. 6 on Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks and spent 25 weeks on the chart.             The group, which toured the world with such rock greats at Linkin Park, Korn, and Deftones, went back to their indie roots with 2012's Minus the Machine on their own Palehorse Records, which was part of Warner Music Label Group. The album debuted at No. 2 on the Hard Rock Albums chart, No. 8 on the Top Rock Albums chart, and No. 26 on The Billboard 200.               ""We self-produced our last few records, so it was good to give the reigns over to someone else for the first time in awhile. We had to really let go and trust and I think in doing that, it opened us to new ideas and helped us stretch creatively,"" says Hasek.                (how to live) AS GHOSTS might be the band's 8th album. But, to them, it feels like a new start. ""There was a heavier, darker tone to our last record because we weren't in a good place,"" adds the singer. ""Ghosts has a brighter side to it because we're all in a really happy, optimistic, and excited place about music and life. We're ready to see how the world embraces it.""  ",,Performance,Trees Dallas,Night Club,2709 Elm Street,",","Dallas,",TX,75226,https://i.axs.com/2020/03/uploadedimage_5e6187549d85e.jpg,,https://www.axs.com/events/394548/10-years-tickets?skin=treesdallas,https://www.treesdallas.com/events/detail/394548

0005,000035,Joywave,,,,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," Joywave has spent much of the past decade holding an aural mirror to society, concocting a distinctively modern approach towards pop music that is both organic and synthetic, much like our own day-to-day lives. The Rochester, NY-based band is now wrapping up work on their hugely anticipated third album, POSSESSION, due via Cultco Music/Hollywood Records in early 2020. Produced at Joywave’s own studio in Rochester by founder Daniel Armbruster, arranged by Armbruster and his fellow band members Joseph Morinelli, Paul Brenner, and Benjamin Bailey, and then mixed by Dan Grech-Marguerat (The Killers, Liam Gallagher, Lana Del Rey), advance tracks from the LP offer a clear display of the band’s evolution from the basement to the big stage, to their current role of full-fledged pop provocateurs, fearlessly assimilating genres, motifs, and big ideas into its own one-of-a-kind identity. Songs such as the unprecedented first single, “Like A Kennedy” or the haunting “Blank Slate” provide both commentary and catharsis by bridging the political with the personal, as Armbruster’s finely etched social commentaries ultimately give way to frank introspection.   “The album really focuses on control,” says Armbruster. “It examines it on a broader societal level but also on a very personal level, like, how do I gain control over my own life and experiences? We turn on the news now and it’s like, what is happening? How am I supposed to go to the grocery store or think about paying my bills or whatever mundane thing I need to do?”   Joywave first came together in 2010 to put live flesh on the bones of songwriter-multi-instrumentalist Armbruster’s original home recordings. A series of visionary mixtapes and EPs followed, as did Big Data’s RIAA gold certified 2013 single, “Dangerous (Feat. Joywave),” a #1 hit at Alternative radio as well as a top 10 multi-format smash. 2014’s HOW DO YOU FEEL? EP was fast followed by the band’s full-length debut album, HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? The album spawned a string of multi-format hits and 2016’s innovative remix collection, SWISH. The following year saw CONTENT make a top 10 debut on Billboard’s “Heatseekers” chart upon its arrival, powered by the Alternative radio favorites, “It’s A Trip” and “Doubt.”   Joywave has proved just as prolific and popular on the road, performing countless headline dates, show-stealing sets at international festivals spanning Lollapalooza, Coachella, Bumbershoot, and the UK’s Reading/Leeds, and support runs with such artists as The Killers, Young the Giant, Foals, Walk the Moon, Bleachers, Metric, Thirty Seconds To Mars, Silversun Pickups and more. Indeed, the increased focus on live activity in turn fueled the POSSESSION sessions, the band’s increasingly complex interplay taking a bigger spotlight in the studio than ever before.   “I think this album reflects our live show a lot more than the first two records did,” Armbruster says. “I still wrote all the songs but the process has become a lot more inclusive. The first record was really something that I wrote in my parents’ basement. The second record was also pretty closed, but now, with this new one, I got all the songs to a point and then really opened things up to the rest of the band. It’s kind of a big step for me actually, to say, Okay, I don’t have to micro-micromanage everything. Now I only have to micromanage. I’ve gone from nano-managing to micromanaging.”   Though not quite finished, it is already abundantly clear POSSESSION will prove a milestone for Joywave, evinced by such extraordinary new tracks as the aforementioned “Like A Kennedy,” the band’s first-ever ballad and perhaps most startlingly original moment thus far. Wedding a strikingly transgressive lyric to a simple melody and tender vocals, the song looks back into history to confront our current polarization, desensitization, and information overload, culminating with a symphonic guitar solo seemingly pulled out of some lost FM broadcast from 1976.   “It’s a media burnout song,” Armbruster says. “It’s anti-chaos. It’s encouraging people to zoom out. Unfortunately I think that everyone will fit it to a political narrative because that’s where society is at right now. It’s not really taking a stand – it’s more like, just stop all the crazy shit. We’re constantly told, this is what’s happening, what do you think about it? But I don’t know. I just want to be fat, old, and happy.”   “Basically the violence just happens over and over and over again,” Armbruster says about the video for “Like A Kennedy.” “There are four or five assassinations throughout the video and each time that I’m shot nobody reacts. It’s like putting the Zapruder film into 2019, where nobody is surprised by the violence and no action is taken each time that it occurs. The violence is allowed to just continue and continue and continue. Obviously that is very relevant to where we’re at now. Every time there’s another mass shooting, all these people die, and you know, thoughts and prayers. And nothing changes. It’s amazing to me that we had a president be the victim of gun violence and still the legislative bodies refused to make any type of meaningful change.”   “Obsession” looks to be another highlight of POSSESSION, its irresistible dance-pop expertly  “encapsulating the history of Joywave into one track,” says Armbruster. “I think that this new record is – hopefully – going to elevate the band and introduce us to a new audience so I thought it was important to catch people up in one song as to what the band has done up till now. It’s like the Cliff’s Notes version of where the band has been. I think it sums us up very well.”   Even at this early stage, it is impossible to view POSSESSION as anything other than a giant leap forward for Joywave, a boldly ambitious work that pushes an already visionary band across ever level, from songcraft and band interaction to freedom of influence, and most of all, perspective.   “One of the ideas on the record is being able to zoom out and have people back out of corners and back out of talking points,” says Daniel Armbruster. “I’m making a three dimensional line where people are able to zoom out enough to see what’s happening and be able to use rational thought. I’m not trying to go left or right – I’m trying to move forward. I’m trying to go up.”  ",,Performance,Trees Dallas,Night Club,2709 Elm Street,",","Dallas,",TX,75226,https://i.axs.com/2020/01/joywave_01-06-20_19_5e136552587c6.jpg,,https://www.axs.com/events/395188/joywave-tickets?skin=treesdallas,https://www.treesdallas.com/events/detail/395188
0005,000036,Mushroomhead,,,UnSaid Fate,TBD,Start time: 8:00 PM. Doors: 8:00 PM,,All Ages," 						Mushroomhead - are one of the most unique and adventurous alternative metal bands working today. Known for their stunningly theatrical live show and artsy masks, this innovative band has forged new ground in the rock world and influenced many other bands to push the envelope and bring art into rock. Formed in the early-1990s in Cleveland Ohio, the band’s combination of metal, rock and atmospheric elements has struck a chord with thousands of fans worldwide.   Mushroomhead have been performing incognito since 1993, when drummer Skinny founded the band. The band was meant to be a side-project so they wore masks to go unrecognized, but after only a few shows they developed a rabid and loyal fan base in Cleveland. Mushroomhead released their 1995 self-titled debut album independently and it went on to became an underground hit. This was history in the making because the band really had no proper distribution. Superbuick followed in 1996 and M3 in 1999, all released via an underground street effort. After the band felt its image and hyper-melodic, heavy style of music was being diluted by other bands jumping into this space, the band started to change their look to reflect nothing out there. After a brief stint on Eclipse Records, a move to Universal Records saw the release of XX (a combination of the past independent releases) in 2001 and XIII in 2003. The band’s last album sold over 200,000 units in the USA alone. Mushroomhead released Savior Sorrow for the pioneering rock label, Megaforce Records (Metallica, Anthrax, Ministry, Warren Haynes, Bad Brains) in 2006. Mushroomhead released “Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children” in the Fall of 2010 and it debuted at #44 on Billboard charts.  It can be said that Mushroomhead’s musical ascendance was a singular, original, aesthetic of eight guys decked out in matching jumpsuits and artsy masks, playing unbelievable, unsettling music. No other band was wearing masks and jumpsuits and purveying this type of ultra-melodic, ultra-dynamic music at the time – Mushroomhead sounded like nothing else. The band’s merging of metal, atmospheric elements, rock, and theatrics mixed with a punk DIY attitude has inspired and spawned other bands. Even though Mushroomhead’s music is rock-leaning in thought, the group remains firmly committed to pushing the envelope and trying new things. Influences range from the driving rhythms and breakneck turns of Pantera, to the dark melodies of Faith No More, to the atmospheric stylings of Pink Floyd, but all done in Mushroomhead style.
